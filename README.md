### To do list
1. ~~Compress all images that aren't being used as backgrounds~~ 
4. ~~Retake background photo (maybe include building + sky, instead of building + ground)~~
5. Add news section to home page âœ…
6. ~~Add to News/Join Us pages~~
7. ~~Grind through Publications Page~~
9. Fix problem with uneven People container sizes 
10. ~~Improve email/scholar/research icons~~
11. ~~Add students' research interests to people page~~
12. ~~Try using "vh" and "vw" in CSS to make website more mobile friendly~~
13. ~~See if we can reuse HTML code, especially for the navigation bar, people page, and publications page~~
14. ~~Use CSS custom variables to set colors for easy change~~
15. Add selected older publications 
16. Add internal protocols on Resources Page that are password protected
17. Find permanent fix to footer issue. Currently, the "fixed" version is only run on the News page (as that page had the greatest issue with a floating footer). However, this "fixed" version creates a very fat footer. 
18. Find a way for the text to first appear in index.html, then the entire page fades in all cool-like.
